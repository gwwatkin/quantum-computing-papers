A collection of papers I worked on studying Quantum Computing.

### Read
It can be read in pdf form
* [More Quantum Algorithms Have Been Found](https://github.com/gwwatkin/quantum-computing-papers/blob/master/More_Quantum_Algorithms_have_been_found.pdf). An overview of the developments in quantum computing since two papers, by Shor in 2003 and Aaronson 2008 respectively, summarized the situation at the time.
* [Maximally Entagled Qubits and Some Applications](https://github.com/gwwatkin/quantum-computing-papers/blob/master/Maximally_Entangled_Qubits.pdf). An overview of entanglement in the context Quantum Computing and application to Quantum Teleportation in Superdense Coding. With [code](https://github.com/gwwatkin/quantum-computing-papers/blob/master/QuantumTeleportation.qasm) to entangle qubits and demonstarte quantum teleportation.
* [Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://github.com/gwwatkin/quantum-computing-papers/blob/master/Introduction_To_quantum_computing.pdf). A very concise summary of some main introductory concepts in quantum computing.
