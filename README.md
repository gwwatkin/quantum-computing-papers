# quantum-computing-papers
A collection of papers I worked on studying Quantum Computing.

### Read
The papers can be read in PDF form:
* [More Quantum Algorithms Have Been Found](https://github.com/gwwatkin/quantum-computing-papers/blob/master/More_Quantum_Algorithms_have_been_found.pdf). An overview of certain developments in quantum algorithms since two reference papers, by Shor (2003) and Aaronson (2008).
* [Maximally Entagled Qubits and Some Applications](https://github.com/gwwatkin/quantum-computing-papers/blob/master/Maximally_Entangled_Qubits.pdf). An overview of entanglement in the context Quantum Computing and applications to Quantum Teleportation and Superdense Coding. With [a small code example](https://github.com/gwwatkin/quantum-computing-papers/blob/master/QuantumTeleportation.qasm) of to entangle qubits and demonstrate Quantum Teleportation.
* [Introduction to Quantum Computing](https://github.com/gwwatkin/quantum-computing-papers/blob/master/Introduction_To_quantum_computing.pdf). A very concise summary of some main introductory concepts in quantum computing.
